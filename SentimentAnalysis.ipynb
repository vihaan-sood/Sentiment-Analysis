      " '\"my experience has been somewhat mixed. i have been using implanon now for nearly 14 months and have decided to get it removed because i bleed every day, all day. i would occasionally stain my underwear and my sheets. it didn\\'t start out that way, for the first month i didn\\'t bleed at all, then i had an epic two week period, then everything was irregular, which has basically been my new norm, sadly. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\ni decided to get rid of the implanon because of the endless bleeding. i should mention that the bleeding was usually pretty light, a bit more than spotting but not quite a period either. other than the endless bleeding, i\\'ve been pretty side effect free, except for minor acne.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\ni didn\\'t get pregnant on it, so yeah! but...blood, a lot of blood.\"'\n",
